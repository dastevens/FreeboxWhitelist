Calculate blacklist from whitelisted numbers

The Freebox Revolution offers a blacklist feature, where you can reject incoming calls if they start with a chosen prefix.

However there is no way to set up a whitelist and reject all other numbers.

As the number of nuisance calls is growing all the time, this app calculates a blacklist that will reject most incoming calls apart from the whitelisted numbers.
